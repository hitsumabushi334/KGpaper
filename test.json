Base B (6.0 mmol) was added dropwise, followed by catalyst C (0.10 mmol, 2 mol%). The reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 2 h. The reaction was quenched with brine, and the organic layer was separated, dried (Na2SO4), and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane/ethyl acetate = 8/2) to afford compound P."

Reducing the catalyst loading to 1 mol% led to incomplete conversion with residual starting material. Changing the solvent from acetonitrile to DMF increased byproduct formation and complicated purification, suggesting that solvent polarity and solvation effects strongly influence yield and purity."
